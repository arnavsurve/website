<Prose>
    I am a third-year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at California State Univerity, Sacramento.
    <br><br>
    Currently, DevOps engineering has been of key interest to me, and I am currently working through the roadmap.sh <a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops" class="text-slate-400 hover:underline">DevOps Roadmap</a>. 
    <br><br>
    I have been focusing on developing a strong foundation in Go and Python programming, as well as familiarizing myself with the RHEL ecoystem with a bare metal install of Fedora Linux. I am quite comfortable with both Debian (apt) and RHEL (dnf) based distributions, but I have a long ways to go before I can call myself proficient.

<!-- I am particularly interested in Linux kernel development. Recently, I have been involving myself with the <a href="https://asahilinux.org/" class="text-slate-400 hover:underline">Asahi Linux</a> project. This is a fork of the Linux kernel with the mission of bringing a polished Linux experience to Apple Silicon. I am currently working on a driver for M2 Pro Macbook Pro webcam support. -->
